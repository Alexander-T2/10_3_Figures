It's an "app", where you can build figures by creating points and covering them with hull (you can choose what mathematical algorithm to choose; it affects the efficincy and speed). When a dot gets inside the hull, it disappears.
You can also move figures, remove the dots, build diagrams of efficiency, manipulate colour of the hull, colour and size of the dots. 
There is also a save/load system.
